<p>GWI is often a phenomenal experience for quizzers who earn the 
privilege to participate. Please help Andrew evangelize GWI to your 
quizzers.</p>
<p>All quizzers are invited to participate in GWI; however, quizzers are
 required to demonstrate 50% material memorization by quoting to one or 
more adults (i.e. coaches, parents, etc.) half the material synonymously
 over any number of sittings.</p>
<p>Andrew is offering GWI coaching workshops this winter and spring for any quizzers intending to attend GWI. Quizzers are <em>not</em> required to pass the quoting bar prior to participating in the coaching workshops.</p>
<p>Historically, we’ve followed the following: Puget Sound quizzers 
typically collect at Alliance Bible Church in Covington, Washington 
starting at 8 AM. We travel east on I-90, making regular photo stops. We
 meet up with Oregon quizzers in Ritzville, Washington for lunch. Then 
we continue on together to Sandpoint, Idaho for an overnight stay in a 
reasonably-priced hotel. We continue into Canada the following morning, 
and we arrive at Crowsnest Camp around 3 PM Friday, give or take. 
Quizzing itself occurs Friday evening and all day Saturday. Saturday 
evening is a quizzer social time. Then Sunday we depart the Camp 
immediately after an early breakfast and travel with minimal quick stops
 home.</p>
<p>We will need adult volunteers. At minimum, we need at least 2 male 
and 2 female adults. And it’s extremely helpful to have multiple adults 
willing to drive.</p>
<p>Everyone will need either a US Passport or “enhanced” driver’s 
license or a copy of their birth certificate plus a government-issued 
photo ID. In addition, quizzers will need a permission slip signed by 
their parents. Attendees should also pack a sleeping bag (and optionally
 a pillow) and towels plus money for meals not at the Camp and for 
miscellaneous shopping.</p>

<p>For the last few season, we’ve hosted Championships at Double K 
Christian Retreat Center in Easton, Washington. It’s been a huge hit 
with quizzers and adults alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams may arrive any time Friday afternoon to get settled and enjoy the camp.</li>
<li>We’ll officially “start” the meet with a short set of introductions and announcements at 5:15 PM, then eat dinner at 5:30 PM.</li>
<li>Quizzing will start after dinner and run for a couple hours or so.</li>
<li>Breakfast Saturday is at 8 AM, after which we’ll resume quizzing until lunch at noon.</li>
<li>I’ll try to build in breaks during the day so quizzers can enjoy the camp.</li>
<li>We’ll complete quizzing Saturday afternoon, followed by awards, then
 dinner and the much anticipated “Senior-Led Awards” at 5:30 PM.</li>
<li>Teams are encouraged to consider staying over Saturday evening if able for additional fellowship time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a majority of our time during the day will be invested in 
quizzing, the camp offers a wide variety of activities. There are forest
 trails to explore, a lake for swimming <em>(if it’s not too cold)</em>,
 options for mountain biking, a rock wall, paint ball, human foosball, 
sand pit volleyball, a gigantic space for Ultimate Frisbee, basketball, 
and a multitude of spaces for groups of quizzers to hang out and 
fellowship. I’ll bring a couple chess boards.</p>
<p>One likely constraint this season is the number of available quiz 
rooms. We’ve typically run 3 rooms at Championships, which is sufficient
 to run 18 teams. However, we’re quite a bit larger this season than 
recent past seasons. We had 27 teams participate at Meet 2. If we have 
anything close to that at Championships, we’ll need to get creative 
about quiz rooms. Fortunately, Double K does have some options. We could
 use the Warn and Bishop lobbies in addition to the Fireside, Cedar, and
 Cougar/Bear rooms.</p>
<p><em>For the time being,</em> Championships is open to all teams. In 
the way-back times when PNW Quizzing regularly had 25+ teams, we limited
 participation at Championships to the top 18 teams. In this way, 
Championships was a reward quizzers earned. We could consider doing this
 for future season; however, there are many multi-order deep effects to 
consider. I figure the best course is to proceed as we previously 
planned for this season, then we can evaluate if we need or want to make
 changes for future seasons.</p>
<p>Do keep in mind <em>(and share with your local organization)</em> that the same logistical conditions will exist this year as the last 3 years. Those conditions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The registration deadline is, as usual, 2 weeks before the meet, <em>prior</em> to which teams must submit both quiz meet registration and camp usage reservation information <em>(including your housing preferences)</em> to Kristine and Sharalyn.</li>
<li>Based on our camp usage information, the camp will pre-purchase 
ingredients for our meals and schedule staffing. Consequently, neither 
PNW Quizzing nor Double K can offer refunds after the registration 
deadline.</li>
<li>
There are some hosting limitations imposed by the camp which we will respect:
<ul>
<li>There will be a boys/men dorm building and a girls/women dorm building.</li>
<li>Each dorm room within each building has multiple bunk beds, typically enough to house 2 teams plus 2 adults.</li>
<li>There must be adults in each room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Please don’t bypass Kristine or Sharalyn and contact the camp directly regarding housing assignments or payments.</strong>
 Kristine and Sharalyn will collect and coordinate all information from 
PNW Quizzing and provide that to the camp in a single, unified message.</li>
<li>As usual, Sharalyn will prepare an invoice for your organization based on your registration and will handle payment collection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Open Championship (IOC 2025)</h3>

<li><strong>Contact:</strong> Christi Adams (<a href="mailto:christiana.adams@icloud.com">christiana.adams@icloud.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>IOC 2025 is set to be the biggest and most fun IOC we’ve held to 
date. We’ll be hosting teams from multiple programs including Nazarene 
and World Bible Quizzing teams, and from across the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The competition is strong but enjoyable, just like my coffee.</p>
<p>Quizzers can register in teams in whatever way they like, either from
 their local church or a mixed team from multiple churches. Or quizzers 
can elect to register solo and ask to be placed on a team with other 
solo quizzers.</p>

<h3>QuizSage Bug at Meet 2 Fixed</h3>
<p>I apologize for a QuizSage bug that resulted in some confusion and 
erroneous team-to-quiz assignments at Meet 2. The bug was entirely my 
fault. Combined with some late registration data changes, some I heard 
of only the morning of the meet, QuizSage data got messed up in some 
places in ugly ways. After the meet, I found and fixed the bug that 
caused all this, and I also cleaned up the Meet 2 data so that the 
statistics and quiz review all show what actually happened at the meet.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened: Meet 2 had 50% more teams and 33% fewer 
Preliminary quizzes relative to the past meets in which we’ve used 
QuizSage. What this means practically is that the probability of team 
point ties in the Preliminary bracket were significantly higher, and 
thus we ended up with several ties. For the meet state page (which lists
 out the schedule sets), QuizSage sorts teams by points and assigns them
 locations. So 27th place by Preliminary points might be on the left in 
Auxiliary quiz 1, and 26st place might be center in Auxiliary quiz 5. 
But in the case where 27th place and 26th place are tied, QuizSage had 
no instructions on how to sort them. So like HAL9000, it started acting 
strange, randomly flipping tied teams whenever the state page reloaded. 
Bad, bad, bad.</p>
<p>To fix this, I told QuizSage to sort teams based on a deeper set of criteria than simply their team points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Points average for Preliminary quizzes <em>(which is the limit of what QuizSage was doing before)</em></li>
<li>Points sum for the Preliminary quizzes <em>(which probably won’t make any difference, but QS will try this step anyway)</em></li>
<li>Highest cumulative positions in Preliminary quizzes <em>(i.e. 1st + 3nd &gt; 3rd + 2nd )</em></li>
<li>Total bonus team points in Preliminary quizzes</li>
<li>Greater total number of quizzes &gt; fewer total number of quizzes <em>(which for Prelims won’t make any difference)</em></li>
<li>Fewer total number of quizzers &gt; more total number of quizzers</li>
</ol>
<p>In theory, I would be shocked if any ties didn’t get sorted by the 
end of step 4. However, in likely very rare cases where a tie still 
exists, I designed steps 5 and 6 to favor what would seem like the 
stronger of the 2 teams.</p>
<p>Part of the fallout of this bug was it resulted in 2 teams not 
getting an Auxiliary quiz and 2 other teams getting 2 Auxiliary quizzes <em>(instead of the 1 quiz each team was suppose to get)</em>.
 This results in teams in Auxiliary not having a fair set of quizzes 
upon which to be evaluated for statistics purposes. So after much 
consideration, Andrew and I decided to weight the Auxiliary bracket at 0
 for Meet 2. <em>(Normally, it’s set at 50% this season, at least until 
we have a few meets of good full-meet data so we can consider 
adjustments based on that data.)</em></p>
<h3>Encourage Electronic Use of QuizSage</h3>
<p>I’ve noticed a few folks printing out the meet state report and the 
type distribution page from QuizSage for use during the meet. You’re of 
course free to do this if you want, but I recommend against it. Instead,
 I recommend using a smartphone and/or tablet. The reason being: 
Unfortunately, roster data can and does change after the registration 
deadline. And depending on the changes, it can become unavoidable for a 
whole draw to need to be rebuilt. So hardcopy schedules, distributions, 
and rosters can easily become deprecated. And if that happens after 
announcements, we don’t have an easy way to communicate that to every 
participant and spectator at the meet.</p>
<p>Moreover, by using a smartphone and/or tablet, participants and 
spectators can get up-to-date statistics and meet state reports. And 
they can also view live scoreboards for each room.</p>
<h3>Lesser Magistrate (LM) Trigger Sets</h3>
<p>As a reminder: LMs are available to any team organization that needs 
them. Each team organization gets their first LM set for free. <em>(The costs are covered by a grant.)</em>
 And additional sets are available. Our cost per set is about $90. And 
501(c)3 tax deductible donations are welcomed and encouraged to help 
keep the grant for first sets funded indefinitely.</p>
<p>I also have a couple boxes full of spare parts. If you have failing 
Mark 1 triggers, I can replace them all with Mark 3 triggers, which are 
much more robust <em>(and look cooler too)</em>.</p>
<p>To help prolong the useful life of your LM sets, please read and 
follow the best practices on the proper care and storage of LMs:</p>
<p><a href="https://cbqz.org/CBQ_system/trigger_sets.md#onthepropercareandstorageoflms">https://cbqz.org/CBQ_system/trigger_sets.md#onthepropercareandstorageoflms</a></p>
<h3>PNW Quizzing Web Site</h3>
<p>The PNW Quizzing web site is where you’ll find the latest, up-to-date
 information on the region’s active season. Please encourage all your 
quizzer parents to sign up for a user account. The biggest reason to do 
that is to maintain a shared contact list, which can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://pnwquizzing.org/user/list">https://pnwquizzing.org/user/list</a></p>
<p>Also, the meet data page will provide you information about if the 
host organization is providing overnight housing and/or lunch:</p>
<p><a href="https://pnwquizzing.org/tool/meet_data">https://pnwquizzing.org/tool/meet_data</a></p>
<h2>Coaching Notes</h2>
<p>I have some specific coaching notes to go over with you; but before 
that, I’d like to share with you an overall governing philosophy about 
coaching:</p>
<p>Coaches are unavoidably spiritual and practical mentors who need to 
exemplify the behaviors we want to encourage in our youth quizzers. We 
ask our youth quizzers to establish and maintain a routine memorization 
schedule, setting aside dedicated time every week to deeply focus on 
verses of Scripture, writing them on their hearts with as much attention
 to detail as possible, ideally verbatim with reference. It would be 
hypocritical of us adults to not devote an equivalent level of focus to 
our coaching responsibilities. As we hold youth quizzers accountable to 
high standards of professionalism, so should we hold ourselves 
accountable.</p>
<p>As coaches, we need to be reliable, proactive, trustworthy, encouraging, and practically helpful.</p>
<p>OK, now on to the specific coaching notes.</p>
<h3>Meet Registration Process</h3>
<p>To review, the meet registration process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>All coaches have access via the PNW Quizzing web site to the season 
schedule and meet registration forms, which become editable immediately 
after the preceding meet.</li>
<li>Coaches can edit and update their registration as often as they’d 
like after the preceding meet and before the registration deadline of 
the next meet.</li>
<li>The registration deadline for the next meet is 2 weeks prior to the 
next meet, at which point the registration form locks until after the 
meet.</li>
<li>Registration data can only be changed after the deadline by contacting the Coordinator.</li>
</ol>
<p>Registration data is used to build the draw, schedule, and roster. 
It’s also used by the host organization for housing and lunch planning 
purposes. It’s the expectation that all coaches will hold themselves 
accountable to ensure their registration data is <em>complete</em> and accurate <em>prior</em>
 to each deadline. If there are any questions, difficulties coaches 
encounter, or anticipated situations where a coach won’t be able to 
ensure complete and accurate registration data is in the system before 
the deadline, coaches should raise these to the Coordinator <strong><em>before</em></strong> the registration deadline.</p>
<p>There may occur situations beyond a coach’s control where changes 
become necessary after the deadline, such as a quizzer becoming sick or a
 family emergency becoming the priority. Then, it’s the expectation the 
coach will contact the Coordinator <em>as soon as possible</em> about 
these data changes. A coach can and should solicit from quizzers their 
intention to participate in the upcoming meet prior to the registration 
deadline; therefore, the only cases where a coach can’t foresee and 
forestall post-deadline data changes are for unanticipatory health, 
weather, or home/family crises.</p>
<p><em>(While there is an automated reminder email sent a week before 
each registration deadline, and occasionally a manual email from the 
Coordinator sent prior to the deadline, it is solely the responsibility 
of the coach to ensure his or her registration data is complete and 
accurate prior to each deadline. As a historical aside, I harken back to
 the mid-1990s. In that era, to register for a meet, you had to 
photocopy a registration form, fill it out by hand, then fax it to the 
Pacific Northwest church district office. This all had to be done 2 
weeks prior to the meet. There were no reminders.)</em></p>
<p>To help encourage accountability to these expectations, I am 
considering asking coaches to publicly share their avoidable 
post-deadline registration changes with the assembly during meet 
announcements.</p>
<h3>Hosting is a Burden; Let’s Make it Light</h3>
<p>Bible Quizzing can realistically only operate when there are team 
organizations willing to host meets. Hosts provide a facility to house 
meet operations, they handle room and event space setup, and they 
coordinate with the building’s owners and build equipment’s operators. 
Hosts may optionally offer overnight housing for away teams, and hosts 
optionally offer lunch on site. As PNW Quizzing participation grows, the
 necessity for overnight housing grows, and thus the burden for hosts 
increases.</p>
<p>To ensure sustainability of Quizzing operations over the long-term, 
we all need to do whatever we can to keep the burden on hosts as light 
as possible. To that end, please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your registration data is complete and accurate prior to the deadline</li>
<li>
When possible, avoid requiring housing and lunch stipulations
<ul>
<li>Certainly include notes about allergies, though</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Remind your quizzers that host-provided overnight housing is not a hotel
<ul>
<li>They should bring a sleeping bag, a towel, and optionally a pillow</li>
<li>They should be aware that a clean floor is a housing option; a bed is a luxury</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Team Spirit and Evangelism</h3>
<p>I’d like to encourage team spirit and evangelism through a variety of threads.</p>
<p>First, team uniforms. Often these are just custom t-shirts for the 
season. But whatever they are, they can be a wonderful way to foster 
esprit de corps. If you have or are developing team uniforms, please 
send me pictures. I’d love to build out a section on the web site with 
team uniforms and grow it season to season.</p>
<p>Second, photos and videos. Whatever photos and videos you have of 
Quizzing, either at meets, on the trips to or from meets, or at 
practices, I’d appreciate you sending me a copy or posting them online 
and sending me a link to them. I’d love to collect more of these and 
post them on our web site.</p>
<p>And third, awards. Please encourage all your teams to stay for (and 
cheer loudly at) meet awards. Some organizations have up to 8 hours of 
drive time ahead of them after the meet, but for those that don’t have 
far to go, please stick around for awards. The presence of all your 
teams during awards, cheering (loudly) for those that have earned 
recognition, goes a long way in encouraging both the award recipients 
and non-recipients alike to memorize between meets.</p>
<h3>Open Book Opportunities</h3>
<p>After each meet, I invest some time analyzing the statistics, and I 
noticed something from Meet 2: Several quizzers from Meet 2 ended up 
getting 0s for the meet when they could have picked up points from open 
book opportunities. Picking up a point, even just 1 point for the meet, 
is better than nothing and can help spark additional motivation to study
 more between meets. And open book is often a gateway to that 1 point.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to pick up an open book point is through use 
of a Finish query list, which is nothing more than an alphabetically 
sorted list of all verses for the meet. This is especially true for 
“foreign” translations. For example, if you’ve memorized NIV and you’re 
in a quiz with all-NIV quizzers, picking up a Finish from the ESV via 
open book is relatively easy. You can usually trigger on the third or 
fourth word reliably.</p>
<p>An easy way to generate this sort of Finish list is by using 
QuizSage’s Reference Generator. Login to QuizSage, and then from the 
home page, click the “Reference Generator” link. Ensure the “Material 
Label/Description” covers the full material for the meet (all 
translations), and ensure the “Alphabetical Material from First Words” 
checkbox is checked. Then print the resulting generated document.</p>
<p>A team can share a single printed reference material. In fact, you can share a single reference across teams if you want.</p>
<h3>Using QuizSage’s Memorization Tools</h3>
<p>Another note about preparation: Quizzers who use QuizSage’s 
memorization tools score better at quiz meets than quizzers who don’t. 
The 3 main tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Memorization — for tracking verses memorized</li>
<li>Memorization Review — for reviewing verses memorized</li>
<li>Memory State — for reporting on verses memorized and to share memory state with others</li>
</ul>
<p>Quizzers can share their memory states with their coaches, which provides the coach the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help keep their quizzers accountable for routine memorization</li>
<li>Build pick-up quizzes based on material the quizzers at practice have memorized</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coaches Can Appeal</h3>
<p>Remember, a coach can appeal a ruling just like a quizzer; however, 
with great power comes great responsibility. The purpose of appeals is 
not to be right nor become right but to determine what is right. The 
appeal process exists to improve rulings so they’re accurate, objective,
 consistent, clear, and thereby fair. Ergo, appeals can be preceded by 
questions, requests for information, etc. without invalidating your 
ability to appeal.</p>
<p>As a coach, if you’re unsure about something, please ask the QM. And 
if you notice something that you think is contrary to the rule book, 
please raise that with the QM.</p>
<p>Some useful documents for coaches to have bookmarked on your smartphone or tablet then are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CBQ Rule Book (<a href="https://cbqz.org/CBQ_system/rule_book.md">https://cbqz.org/CBQ_system/rule_book.md</a>)</li>
<li>Magistrate Best Practices (<a href="https://cbqz.org/tenets/magistrate_best_practices.md">https://cbqz.org/tenets/magistrate_best_practices.md</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Governance Updates</h2>
<p>As a reminder, there are 2 governance organizations to consider for 
Quizzing. “PNW Quizzing” is the self-governing, self-instantiating 
regional organization currently covering the geography of Washington, 
Oregon, and Northern Idaho. “Christian Bible Quizzing” or CBQ is the 
international organization that “oversees and supports local and 
regional Quizzing operations internationally with the mission to 
encourage the most people to memorize the most verses of Scripture.”</p>
<p>As PNW Quizzing grows, there will come a time (perhaps fast 
approaching) when it’ll be practically valuable (for optimized missional
 outcomes) to split our single region up into separate regions, 
collaborating and occasionally even quizzing together, but typically 
running separate local season schedules. Even now, our vast geography 
may be a limiting factor to maximal outcomes. It would take nearly 20 
hours to travel round trip from Post Falls, Idaho to Medford, Oregon.</p>
<h3>PNW Quizzing</h3>
<p>Recently, PNW Quizzing established a unique bank account and entirely
 separate ledger. These actions are the last steps in a fully 
independent PNW Quizzing. (Prior to this, PNW Quizzing was operating 
under a parent ministry’s umbrella.) We’ve also initiated an annual 
bookkeeping review cycle with an independent, external CPA. (If you have
 any questions about any of this or would like more details, please 
contact the Board.)</p>
<p>My primary evangelism focus for 2025 is to plant more Oregon team 
organizations in an effort to grow Oregon large enough that we can 
reasonably split PNW Quizzing into strong, self-supporting north and 
south regions. This will significantly reduce the sum commute hours 
required and associated costs for many of the meets. But I would love to
 still include in our season schedules the occasional "ultra-meet" with 
everyone.</p>
<p>I need your help evangelizing, though. If you know of anyone able to 
coach a team of even as small as 2 quizzers in a new locale somewhere in
 Oregon, please reach out to them and CC me. CBQ can provide new team 
organizations their first LM and all resources necessary to run 
practices.</p>
<p>And lastly: As some of you have noticed, I’m working to eventually 
exit from the role of regional Coordinator for PNW Quizzing, maybe 
sometime over the next couple years; perhaps slightly longer. But I’m 
not going to vanish. As long as I remain healthy enough to participate 
in Quizzing, I don’t foresee ever leaving Quizzing; but I believe it’s 
be better for PNW Quizzing to install new regional Coordinators from 
time to time than indefinitely languish under unchanging leadership. I 
look forward to when I can fully support the next regional Coordinator.</p>
<p>To this end, I’m working on automating, delegating, and/or 
eliminating everything I do as Coordinator. Some of things will migrate 
from the region to the international level. For example, I’d like to 
establish a training academy for quiz magistrates and coaches, which 
would best be placed at the CBQ level.</p>
<h3>Christian Bible Quizzing</h3>
<p>CBQ’s bylaws require a semiannual General Assembly business meeting. 
The next one will be via Zoom and held on Thursday, February 6 starting 
at 6:00 PM PST. All such meets are open to anyone, though only Qualified
 Delegates may vote; however, routine attendance at these meetings is 
required to become a Qualified Delegate. This meeting should be quite 
short; mostly status updates and boilerplate votes.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in attending, please sign up for a CBQ user account here:</p>
<p><a href="https://cbqz.org/user/sign_up">https://cbqz.org/user/sign_up</a></p>
<h3>Tax-Deductible Donations</h3>
<p>And lastly, if you are able, please consider a donation to either 
“Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing” and/or “Christian Bible Quizzing”. 
Both are 501(c)3 organizations.</p>
