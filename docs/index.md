## What is Bible Quizzing?

Bible Quizzing is a Christian sport in which teams of participants compete on
Bible memorization in a context that requires a combination of speed, accuracy,
and strategy and a culture that inspires collaboration, fellowship, and mutual
encouragement.

At its core, Quizzing has always been about writing God's Word on hearts.
By appealing to the transformational power of Scripture, Quizzing is the
catalyst that changes many lives across the world. Quizzing thrives in several
countries beginning with its origin in the United States and Canada but has
spread to the Dominican Republic, Jordan, and far beyond.

Bible Quizzing is a powerful ministry that claims God's promise that "No word of
God will return empty."

## Why join Quizzing?

Quizzing offers so much more than just competition and sport. The program
involves memorizing a specific book or books of the Bible each quiz year. By
becoming involved in memorization, quizzers develop a love and respect for the
Bible. The Word is written on their hearts, and consequently it dynamically
influences them. Bible Quizzing helps youth develop a genuine concern for
others. Quizzers learn to rely on the Lord and not themselves to attain their
goals. Quizzing also gives a biblical perspective for everyday life and helps in
the application of scriptural principles.
