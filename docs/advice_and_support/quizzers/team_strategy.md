# Team Strategy

Team Strategy is about maximizing your team's points in a quiz. Some principles
to adhere to:

- Never speed up a quiz. The beginning of a quiz is a negotiation of sorts as
  teams try to gauge the pace. It's better to be the team jumping on a toss-up
  on question 3 than sitting because you erred on an unnecessarily fast jump.
- Know your opponent. Know if your opponent has a key verse quizzer, other
  specialty question quizzer, or knows references. In prelims you can pick off
  questions that are easiest to you. In finals you can try to prevent specialty
  quizzers from other teams from getting their favored questions.
- Own the toss-ups. If you are prudent in your jumping, you will get the
  opportunity to jump on toss-ups after an error. Toss-ups are a great way to
  easily boost your team score.
- Emphasize 3rd, 4th and 5th quizzer bonuses. Your team scores will jump
  dramatically if you have depth on your team.
