- A maximum of three situation questions may be asked about the quote (e.g. at most 3 of the interrogatives)
- The quote must start either at the beginning of a quote or at the beginning of a sentence within a quote.
- Syntax: "Question number two is a situation question, I need to know who said it and how, question number two, question, "The virgin will be with child..."

## Tips

- The best way to prepare for situation questions is to make a list of all quotations, along with answers to each of the possible interrogatives.
- Keep in mind that if a quotation has a more distinctive "how" or a "when" the quizmaster is more likely to ask those. Keep in mind that quizmasters are more likely to write situation questions on memorable quotations. Keep in mind that if a quotation has a distinctive "when" or "where" it's pretty unlikely for a quizmaster to ask that situation question and not require the "when" or "where." This can be helpful for distinguishing between similar quotations. In all of this, remember that these are guidelines and likelihoods, and not requirements of the quizmaster.
