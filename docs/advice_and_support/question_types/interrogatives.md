  verse.

  or which.

  the middle*.
- The question must have a **completed unique**-word *or* unique-phrase within
  the first five words.

## Tips

The tips are organized into tiers to help focus your reading.

### For Rookies and Beginners

- Reading the material helps a lot with this question type since the answers
  don't have to be word perfect.
- Since interrogatives to do not require references, this is a good question
  type for quizzers who struggle with remembering references, although quizzers
  who know references can answer these just as well.

### For veteran quizzers (1-3 years or so)

- Quizzers should take extra care to watch the quizmaster's mouth. The forming
  is a “w” shape indicates that the interrogative word is likely beginning the
  question and will not give the quizzer much help to figure out the answer.
- The shape of the quizmaster's mouth and the inflection of their voice can give
  big clues to the next word/syllable that is coming. At fast jumping speeds
  that little bit of extra information can be the difference.

### For quizzers with a goal of making Great West

- Don't jump on w's! There will be those lucky people who jump on a W, get 1
  syllable and guess the right answer, but the probability of doing that is very
  low, and more often than not, quizzers error on W jumps.
- Learn the unique words. Most interrogative questions will have a unique word
  in them.
- Pay attention to which interrogative (who, what, when, etc) is used in the
  question, because this will help you identify what information you need to
  give for the answer.

### For quizzers with a goal of making Internationals

- The requirement that the question must contain a completed unique-word or
  unique-phrase within the first 5 words can be problematic as the requirement
  regards words and not syllables. Words vary in length. Some questions are
  unique early (2-3 syllables) while others may not be unique until much later.
