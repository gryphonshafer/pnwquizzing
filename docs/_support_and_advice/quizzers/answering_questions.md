# Answering Questions

So now you've studied and gotten the jump on a question. What are the best ways
to get it right?

- Wait for the quizmaster to call your name, lest you answer someone else's
  question.
- Stand up confidently, walk to the microphone (or quizmaster's table) and
  answer slowly and loudly, careful to enunciate. If the quizmaster cannot hear
  you or understand you, you may get a question wrong even if you were saying
  the right stuff! It is your responsibility to make the quizmaster hear and
  understand you.
- Always quote the verse containing the question and answer (or at least give
  the impression you are quoting), rather than answering with a definite
  "answer." That way the quizmaster is much less likely to rule you incorrect
  for giving an incorrect answer. As long as you are quoting the material the
  quizmaster will usually let you keep going. It never hurts to start at the
  beginning of the verse.
- If no answer comes to you, don't worry! Always give some answer, even if it
  means quoting a randomly picked verse. Give yourself a fighting chance of
  getting it right and if you happen to pick the correct verse you'll look like
  a genius!
- Remember that you'll have to provide the question on all reference questions.
  The quizmaster will prompt you, but don't let it catch you off guard. For tips
  on providing the question, go here.
- Do not read too much into what the quizmaster says. (part 1) If you quote
  everything word perfect, but add something, the quizmaster will say "again."
  If you quote everything word perfect, but left out something in the middle,
  the quizmaster will likely say "again." If you quote something incorrectly,
  the quizmaster will say "again." So while again gives you some information
  about why you aren't correct yet, it only gives you a little.
- Do not read too much into what the quizmaster says. (part 2) If you are
  quoting from the correct passage, but have many things incorrect, the
  quizmaster may just look at you, or may say "more." If you are quoting from an
  incorrect passage, the quizmaster may just look at you, or may say "more." If
  you have quoted everything word perfect, but are missing some information, the
  quizmaster will likely say "more." Just because a quizmaster says "more"
  doesn't mean you are in the correct passage. And just because a quizmaster has
  said nothing doesn't mean you are in the incorrect passage.
