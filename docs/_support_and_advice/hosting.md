# Hosting a Quiz Meet

Hosting a quiz meet is a huge need year after year and an enormous blessing to
the quizzing program. Here is a checklist of the responsibilities of host
churches. While it seems like a lot, quizzing officials are in charge of
communication all responsibilities to you, and making everything as easy as
possible.

- **Adequate space.** We need 4 quiz rooms, 1 coaches' room and 1 statistics room, as well as space inside or outside for quizzers to hang out when not quizzing. Quiz Room #1 is usually the sanctuary, as a large amount of audience space and a stage are needed. Room #1 must have microphone(s) as well as a projector. All quiz rooms and the statistics rooms must have adequate electricity plugs (and extension cords since the officials table is usually in the center of the room). 12 metal folding chairs (without pads!) are necessary for 3 of the quiz rooms. All other chairs (for spectators, officials, etc don't have to be any special kind).
- **A short worship time on Saturday morning.** This is often done by quizzers from the hosting church, but occasionally church staff may be required. This entails about 15 minutes of songs.
- **A short devotional time.** While occasionally handled by someone in the quizzing program, this is usually handled by someone at the church. This goes about 15-20 minutes.  It’s been our experience that the most popular devotional topic is “you’ve memorized the verses in your head, make sure they have an impact on your heart also.” While this topic can definitely be a useful one to hear, it’s become quite banal to those within our program, especially if coming from a leader/pastor who has not memorized hundreds and thousands of verses like many of the quizzers. Because of this we ask that a different devotional topic is chosen.
- Housing for quizzers, coaches and officials on Friday night. This is the largest commitment of hosting a quiz meet. There are currently around 150 people involved with quizzing. The amount that need housing will vary, depending on your geographical location. If you are located in the South Seattle/Tacoma area, a much smaller number will need housing than if you are a church in Oregon, east of the mountains in Washington, or much North of Seattle. The Meet Logistics Coordinator will be in touch with you regarding this.
- Lunch on Saturday. Each church may charge $5/person for lunch. Church staff and facilities will be needed.
- This last bit is not a requirement, but a willingness to commit to hosting as early as the summer, or even the year before is wonderful!
