# Memorizing and Studying

This is a tough one as no two people memorize the same way.

So my advice is this: memorize and study in as many different ways as possible.
Read the material to yourself, read the material aloud to yourself, read the
material to someone else, explain the material to someone else, read the
material aloud dramatically, write the material, find a CD of the material and
listen to it, use mnemonics, color code your material, snap on key words, quote
verse-by-verse backwards, create lists on the material, quiz other people,
listen to other people quote, do a bible study on the material, etc. The more
ways you engage with the material, the deeper your level of understanding and
retention will be. And the more rewarding it will be!

Oh, and memorize the references. They enhance your knowledge of the material to
another level. Also, you become proficient at QT and CVR questions, some of the
safest questions to target.

## Creating Lists

Lists are only necessary for the better quizzers, but for those quizzers they
are an integral way to gain an edge over your competition.

As you become familiar with the material, question types and how quizmasters
write questions, you will be able to write your own.

It's best to type them into some spreadsheet/database so you can sort by by
question beginning, chapter and verse and question type. This will enable you to
know what words and phrases are similar and which are unique. You can take this
as far as     you want, by finding specialty questions that only occur once in a
chapter, or similar beginning questions that are within context of each other.

These lists can enable you to prepare for a meet and strategize jumping
strategies by knowing:

- Which chapter have few reference questions and which have a lot
- Which chapter have references (QT, CVR) that you can jump on. e.g. don't have 3:22, 3:23, 3:26, etc
- What mouth shapes to avoid (usually "W" and "T")
- Exact lists of rare questions such as MA CVR and MA CR. Pre-jumping is often necessary to win jumps on these questions.

## Reviewing

No quizzer, no matter how good their memorizing ability is, can memorize
something once and expect it to be there the next time they need to access it.
Reviewing the material is crucial for continued knowledge of the material at a
high level. Constant and dedicated review can be a huge differentiator between
you and other quizzers. I observe many quizzers who will memorize however much
material they want to memorize (a few verses, key verses, all verses, etc) and
once they have it down, don't come back and review. Review will help you expose
problem areas and will increase your overall comfort level with the material.

So try:

- Quoting through all the material daily (really crazy, but it's been done before)
- Reading through the material daily (less crazy)
- Quoting through a chapter each day
- Listening to someone else quote the material
- Reading the material out loud with a sibling, parent or fellow quizzer
- Quote through the material in different ways (by verse backwards, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, etc, completely random, or other ways).

Also, try to finish your memorizing about a week before each quiz meet, and use
that last week to just review. You'll know the material way better for the meet!
(and years later the verses will jump to mind much quicker....you'll never know
when you need them!)

## Similar Words and Phrases

Quizzing Errors usually fall into one of three buckets:

- Jumping on unique material, but not knowing it (either not being able to
  recall it at all, or not being able to quote adequately)
- Jumping on vague material
- Jumping on unique material, *but quoting other similar unique material*

I want to discuss the *third point*, as it affects quizzers of all knowledge
levels, and is a quite frustrating error for a quizzer to make.

Often times a quizzer will jump on unique material (e.g. Heb 5:5 "so Christ
also.."), but will recall similar material, (e.g. 9:28 "so Christ was..").
Another example would be: (Heb 5:1 "Every high priest is selected" and Heb 8:3
"Every high priest is appointed"). Or you could have two wildly similar
passages, but vaguely different: (Heb 8:10 and 10:16). In all three cases it is
very easy to mistakenly recall the incorrect passage, resulting in an error. The
method for eliminating these errors is twofold:

- Be able to quote the material with such accuracy that simply hearing unique
  material always triggers recall of the correct passage. This results after
  lots of time spent studying, and concentrated quoting, focusing on 100%
  accuracy.
- Make a list! When you see two similar passages side-by-side you can more
  easily see all the differences and begin to differentiate them in your mind.
