## Finish This and the Next

### Facts

- These are just like FT's, but require the quizzer to quote two consecutive verses.
- They are specified at the beginning of the year.
- Reading Syntax: "Question Number One is a Finish This question; Question Number One, Question, What is man that you..."

### Tips

## Quote

### Facts

- There can be 1-2 Quote questions per quiz.
- Quote questions come from the key verse pool.
- They must be quoted word perfect.
- The quizmaster will give the reference, the quizzer must quote the verse.
- Context is only the verse. The quizzer may not go into other verses.
- Reading Syntax: "Question Number One is a Quote question. Question Number One, Question, Quote Hebrews Chapter One Verse Three"

### Tips

- Memorize all the verses on the key verse list, including their references.
- You should know from memory which verses are key verses. This helps when you pre-jump and don't get the complete reference.
- If you pre-jump and the quizmaster does not finish the complete reference, you will have to give the reference as part of your answer. Some quizmasters will say "more" or "what is your reference" but some may not.

## Quote These Two Verses

### Facts

- They are just like QT's, but require the quizzer to quote two consecutive verses.
- They are specified at the beginning of the year.
- Reading Syntax: "Question Number One is a Quote These Two Verses question. Question Number One, Question, Quote Hebrews Chapter Three Verses Three and Four"

### Tips

- It's extra important to have these confidently word perfect because they're long and you probably won't have time to correct yourself if you make a mistake. Memorize which chapters have only one paired verse. That way, when you hear that chapter, you can jump immediately and still get the question right! If a chapter has more than one possible QT2V question, you can usually still jump fairly fast because there are rarely more than 3 per chapter. Make sure to know which verses in each chapter are paired, so if the quizmaster only says "twenty-" you will probably be able to figure out what verses it is.

## Miscellaneous Tips

- Before a meet, you can make sure you have all the quotes down by handing someone a quiz book and a key verse list and having them say a reference and look up the verse. If you get it right without having to correct yourself at all, they can cross that number off the list.
- Write the verse on a whiteboard, read it multiple times, erase one word each time you say the verse until everything is erased and you have it memorized
- Try reading the verse several times and then writing the first letter of each word down and saying the verse looking at just the letters until you have it memorized.
- For all Finish questions (FTV, FT2V, FT, FTN), make an alphabetized list (alphabetic by how the verse starts). Then you can see which key verses start the same way as another key verse of the same type.
