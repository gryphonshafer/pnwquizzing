# 2023-2024 Proposed Season Schedule

The following are the **proposed** dates and material ranges for meets in the 2023-2024 season.

*This proposed schedule assumes quizzers will start memorizing after Labor Day at a rate of 1 chapter per week, with 1 week of review prior to the first 3 district meets and 2 weeks of review prior to district meets 4 and 5. Note that the book sequence is reordered to make it possible to have fewer intra-book material breaks at the meets.*
