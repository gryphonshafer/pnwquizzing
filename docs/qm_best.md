# Quizmaster Best Practices

What follows are quizmaster best practices that overlay the rules and policies defined elsewhere. The following are required prerequisites and standard operations for all quizmasters in PNW Bible Quizzing. These are not the *only* duties, rules, and policies for the quizmaster to follow.

## Rules and Material Acquaince

All quizmasters must be thoroughly acquainted with all rules relevant to the conduct of quizzes. This includes but is not limited to any and all governing rule books, district-specific rules, and local policies. A quizmaster should know the relevant, current rules sufficient enough to accurately describe them without reference to documentation.

All quizmasters should be acquainted enough with the season's material such that they recognize unique phrases throughout.

## Available Tools and Resources

All quizmasters must be prepared for all quizzes with readily available and easily accessed electronic and searchable versions of:

- All relevant rules and policies
- Quiz schedule and teams/quizzers roster
- Current memorization material via the CBQZ application

All quizmasters must be capable and comfortable searching and finding topics and phrases in all the above electronic content.

All quizmasters must be familiar with their laptop and associated software, and keep software and the operating system (OS) up to date such that:
- Forced updates and/or computer restarts do not delay quizzing
- Out of date software does not cause issues with CBQZ
- All required hardware is brought by the quizmaster (e.g. extension power cord, 2 to 3 plug adapters, etc)

All quizmasters will use a question set validated and verified by the Rules Committee Leader loaded into and running through the CBQZ application. All quizmasters must be capable and comfortable using all quizmastery functional aspects of the CBQZ application including:

- Quiz setup
    - Correct data entry for all form fields
    - Chapter selection and weighting
- Quiz operations
    - Generated quiz questions overview review
    - Question replacement (as needed)
    - Material reference lookup and search
    - Question marking (as necessary)
    - Scorekeeping and quiz event tracking
    - Closing quizzes when completed

## Quiz Questions

Prior to beginning a question, the quizmaster should verify the validity of the question. This should in no way be construed to mean anything other than basic rule-book legality alone. The quizmaster should not throw out questions that are considered harder, or simpler, or of an unexpected type for the specific question situation in the quiz. The quizmaster should not alter the difficulty of a quiz based on the type of quiz it may be, such as preliminary round, consolation brackets, or championships.

Quizmaster must begin each question with the following standard preamble:

1. `Question number N` *(can be repeated to quiet the room)*
2. The quizmaster appends any special jumping considerations to the last iteration of the previous step:
    - If question N is a tossup or bonus: `is a TOSSUP/BONUS for TEAM(S)`
    - If question N is for all teams, the quizmaster may optionally add `is for all teams` or preface the question announcement with `all teams are jumping on`
3. `Question number N is a TYPE question` or `It is a TYPE question`
    - TYPE may be repeated for additional clarity
    - TYPE may be repeated in reverse and broken apart, such as "chapter and verse, multiple-answer"
4. If TYPE is a SIT, the quizmaster will now list the required answer components
5. `Question number N... Question...`
6. Read the content of the question

The ellipses above should be of a short duration and must always be consistent across all questions in a quiz and meet. The time spacing between each item in the list above must always be consistent across all questions in a quiz and meet.

The reading of all parts of the standard preamble and the reading of the question content must be at a consistent pace across all questions in a quiz and meet.

Number 5 from above should always be the last thing said by the quizmaster before beginning to read the content of the question.  If the quizmaster needs to pause for any reason during the preamble, needs to warn a quizzer about their light being on, or any other disruption to the preamble, number 5 should be repeated, even if it has already been said. 

The quizmaster should abruptly stop reading and freeze as soon as possible when a quizzer's light illuminates. This abrupt stop must be as close to exactly consistent as possible across all questions in a quiz and meet. The jumping speed of the quizzer should never be anticipated. Only after the abrupt stop and a short pause should the quizmaster move his or her lips or any other part of their body.

Following the abrupt stop, the quizmaster should correlate the illuminated light to a quizzer's name in the CBQZ application's scorekeeping section based on bib number. The quizmaster should then prepare to click on the quizzer's name. The quizmaster then calls the quizzer's name then immediately clicks on the quizzer's name.

## Quiz Answers

When listening to a quizzer answer a question, the quizmaster must remain silent with only the following being the acceptable exceptions:

- If a quizzer provided all the information in the answer except the clarification of a pronoun present which is part of the answer, the quizmaster will say, `Can you identify PRONOUN?`
- On reference question, if the quizzer has given all the information in the question and the answer and the complete question was not read, the quizmaster will ask, `What's your question?`
- On a finish or quote type question, once the quizzer has quoted to the end of the required verse, if the quote is not yet correct, the quizmaster will say, `Again.` This will occur as often as needed until the quizzer quotes the verse perfectly or the 30 second time limit expires.
- If a quizzer, upon clearly pausing in reply after having attempted a full answer, is missing information required in either the question or answer, the quizmaster will, when the quizzer is not speaking, say, `More.`
- If a quizzer, upon clearly pausing in reply after having attempted a full answer, has said a word or phrase which is not incorrect but also not yet correct, the quizmaster will, when the quizzer is not speaking, say, `Again.`
- On a SIT question, when the quizzer has completed the quotation required for the question, the quizmaster will say, `Quote is complete.`

In all cases, the quizmaster must prompt and react as close to exactly the same as possible across every question of every quiz in a meet.

Prompts a quizmaster is NOT allowed to say:
- When a quizzer has correctly answered a Quote or Chapter Verse Reference question, but the full reference has not been given (either by the quizmaster or the quizzer), "More on the reference."
- On Situation questions, "More on the quote" or "More on the answer."
- On Situation questions, when the quizzer has completed the quotation, "and you answer?"

## Question Rulings

When in doubt about a quizzer's responses being sufficiently incorrect to be counted incorrect, allow the quizzer to continue through his or her 30-second answer period. Make rulings efficiently. If in doubt, rule in the quizzer's favor, then pause briefly to allow a challenge.

Always be open to challenge and be willing to evaluate whatever the captains feel is in error.

In all cases, the quizmaster must rule as close to exactly the same as possible across every question of every quiz in a meet.

No question should be thrown out, unless the quizmaster made a mistake, or unless the question is deemed invalid. When faced with a difficult, subjective ruling, make your best ruling - questions should not be thrown out just because the ruling is difficult. 

## Closing a Quiz

When a quizmaster completes a quiz, the quizmaster will click the "Close" button.
