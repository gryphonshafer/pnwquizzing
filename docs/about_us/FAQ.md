# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

What is Bible Quizzing?
: Bible Quizzing is a scripture memory and
competition program for youth. Each year a portion of the New Testament is
designated as the "material" which constitutes the competition material. This
material follows an 8-year rotation. The competition takes place in the form of
"meets" where all quizzers compete against each other in "quiz" format.

What are the benefits of Bible Quizzing?
: You gain many great things from quizzing:

- The Word of God in your heart and on your mind. You'd be surprised what you
  remember 10 years later!
- Worship and teaching time at each meet.
- Lifelong friends!
- Increased aptitude and confidence in learning, reading, reading aloud, public
  speaking, memorizing, studying, time management, executing in pressure
situations, and team work.
- The opportunity to excel while quizzing in the program and the opportunity to
  give back once your quizzing eligibility is exhausted.
- The opportunity to invite and be a witness and friend to non-believing friends.

Who is eligible to quiz?
: Any youth who will be 18 or younger at any point during the quiz season and
has adequately to their local ministry organization's head coach demonstrated
maturity sufficient to be a quizzer may participate.

What is the yearly format?
: The PNW Quizzing season typically runs from September through May.

Isn't Bible Quizzing a large time commitment?
: Not as much as you'd think. It's far less time required than a typical high school sport. Besides the
regular season district meets, the time commitment can vary from quizzer to quizzer. The
very best quizzers will likely be putting in a minimum of 3+ hours of studying
each week, while the less-serious or "social" quizzers may put in that much in
a month. PNW District has no studying requirement. Some churches
choose to institute a memorization requirement or have quizzers set goals at
the beginning of the year, but this is handled on a church-by-church basis.

You want me to memorize how many verses?
: You'd be surprised what you're capable of with a little determination
and discipline, alongside friends who encourage you and compete with you. Start
by memorizing just a few, and if you get those down, forge forward for more.

What does it take to start a Bible Quizzing program?
: The main thing a new quizzing program needs is a dedicated coach;
someone who can run practices, attract teens to the program, and handle the
logistics. This coach is rarely a youth pastor.
More often than not, the church does not
need to financially support the bible quiz program.

I know nothing about Bible Quizzing. How could I possibly start a program?
: There are many experienced officials and coaches who are happy to
help you get started! Very little quizzing-specific knowledge is required, just
a passion to get teens in the Word and an ability to manage a program. The
details will come with time and everyone you meet will be happy to answer
questions.
