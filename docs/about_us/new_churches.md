# New Churches

Starting a brand new quiz program can be a daunting task, mainly from lack of
information. Here is a quick primer on the tasks and costs of starting a quiz
program. This list is not meant to overwhelm; it's meant to illuminate
responsibilities so each church has complete visibility into what it takes to
begin and maintain a quiz program. There are countless people involved with the
District that would be more than happy to provide you with information,
first-hand experience, and other tips on starting a quiz program.

1. Recruit quizzers. This can be done with the help of people in the church, any assistant coaches or others.
2. Decide on cost to quiz for quizzers. Each church pays costs to the District. Each church also sets a cost for each quizzer. Details are in the Cost Calculator Spreadsheet.
3. Notify the District of the team(s). There is no official requirement here, but it's nice for the District to know about new team(s) in advance of the registration for the 1st meet. Also, you'll get hooked into information.
4. Buy quizzing equipment. The cost of quizzing equipment is a big hurdle for new churches, but thankfully, it's a one-time cost. A complete set of pads (3 sets of 4) and console costs about $500. This is what you need to run quizzes. In today's technologically savvy world, you can cut down on these costs a bit by running the quiz through a laptop rather than a console. This will save you about $100. Quizzing books (pocket sized books of the year's material, with concordance) run about $5 each. These of course you'll purchase every year. Details are in the Cost Calculator Spreadsheet.
5. Set a practice schedule. Most churches have a practice on Sunday, either before or after the morning church service since everyone is already at the church. Many churches also have a 2nd practice each week.
6. Run practices. Practices are comprised of study time, quoting time, and quizzing time. Whoever will be running the actual quizzes in practice will have to learn how to do so from the Rule Book. All the other aspects of practice are no different than AWANA, help the kids memorize in whatever way works best.
7. Register for the meets. Registration is due two weeks prior to each meet.
8. Coordinate Logistics. Make sure your quizzers know when the meets are, and that they will likely have to leave early from school on that Friday, depending on the meet location. The quizzers likely need permission slips for your church. Housing is provided at quiz meets. You will need transportation to the meets.
9. Coaching. At the meet you will go with your team to each quiz. It helps if you keep your own score as you have to initial the official scoresheet at the end of each quiz.
10. Coaches' Meetings. Attend the coaches' meeting each meet.
11. Chaperone. Chaperone at the quiz meet and at the overnight host's house.
