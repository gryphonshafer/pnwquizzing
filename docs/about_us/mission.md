# PNW Bible Quizzing Mission and Purpose

Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing is affilitated with Christian and Missionary
Alliance (CMA) Bible Quizzing. The PNW district consists of, and is open to,
all theologically traditional Christian churches in Washington and Oregon. See
[our bylaws](/district_governance/bylaws.md "PNW Bible Quizzing Bylaws") for
more information.

The CMA Bible Quizzing Mission Statement reads:

> The mission of quizzing is to see visible evidence of the application of God's
> Word in the lifestyle of each participant.

Bible Quizzing is a ministry of Life Impact Ministries/CMA to assist teens to
connect with God in a deeper way by Experiencing Him and Expanding His Kingdom.
It accomplishes this by:

- Providing teens with an opportunity to be involved in the systematic study and
  application of God's Word
- Building character, instilling self-discipline and encouraging prayer and unity
- Equipping young people with the capacity to serve in other areas of ministry
