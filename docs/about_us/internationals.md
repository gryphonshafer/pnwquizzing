# Internationals Meet

The Internationals Meet is the culmination of the competitive quiz year for the
C&MA denomination bible quizzing programs. The bible quizzing districts are the
same geographical districts as the CMA districts. Both USA districts and
Canadian districts compete at Internationals.

Districts are allowed to send teams based on the size of the district. To send
more than one team, you must have 50 district quizzers per # of teams you are
sending to Internationals (e.g. 100 quizzers in the district to be able to send
2 teams to Internationals, 150 for 3, etc).

Internationals teams are not required to have 5 team members. However, almost
all do.
