# PNW Rules Changelog

The following are entries in a changelog for Bible Quizzing rules as adopted by Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing. This page and its content are provided for reference purposes but are not the canonical source for rules. The canonical sources are first the [IBQ Rule Book](IBQ_rule_book.md) followed by the [PNW Rules](PNW_rules.md) document.

## November 28, 2022

In terms of calculated scoring averages for individuals, all quizzes at a meet except meet finals quizzes will count at 100%.

## November 19, 2022

There will be no multi-verse Q/F type questions allowed, such as FTN, Q2V, and F2V.

## May 5, 2022

Added an "Eligablity" section to describe what was already policy with regard to eligablity of ministry orgnaizations (i.e. churches) and youth.

## April 27, 2022

Removed the "Quizmaster Prompts" section of the PNW rules since the [IBQ Rule Book](IBQ_rule_book.md) (as of the 2021-2022 season version) matches the prompts PNW should use. *(Although this has been followed in PNW throughout the 2021-2022 season, this change to this documentation is only now getting implemented due to not realizing it needed to be implemented until now.)*

## February 20, 2020

*(The follow rule change, while accepted on the date above, does not come into effect until the beginning of the 2020-2021 season.)*

Prior to each season, the Rules Committee or a person or group they appoint for this purpose will define and publish two versions of the upcoming season's Key Verses List (KVL), a public and private version. The public version will be published widely to all quizzing participants. The private version will be made available only to official question writers.

The public KVL will not specify which FTV or Quote sub-types will be used for any given verse; only the private KVL will include this information. For example, the public list will not indicate whether two consecutive verses will be asked as an F2V/Q2V pair or whether they will be two separate FTVs/Quotes.

Every FTV or Quote question must come only from the verses defined in the KVL. Any deviation from this is open to challenge.

The C&MA rulebook prohibits FTVs on verses that start with the same 5 words as any other verse in the whole material. Within PNW, however, FTV questions cannot be asked on verses that start with the same 5 words as any other verse in the KVL. F2V questions cannot be asked if the first verse in the pair starts with the same 5 words as any other verse in the KVL. FT and FTN questions must be unique within the first 5 words when compared to every other sentence-start or quotation-start in verses that are part of the KVL. There are no such restrictions on Quote or Q2V questions, which can be asked on any verse in the KVL.

The sub-types specified in the private KVL will be based on the C&MA rulebook guidelines quoted below, with additional PNW-specific clarifications provided. These guidelines are not open to challenge or protest but are meant to guide the Rules Committee in creating the private KVL and are explained here to inform quizzers on what to expect:

- F2V, Q2V, and FTN questions are "used when a verse is not strong enough on its own and needs another verse to explain it, or when two verses combined form an even stronger thought." There is large room for interpretation on what forms "an even stronger thought," so quizzers should accordingly be prepared for both the single verse and the paired verses for many of the areas in the material where there are two consecutive key verses.
- FT and FTN questions must start "in the middle of the verse," either "at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of a quotation." FT and FTN are used for verses that are not well-suited for an ordinary FTV or F2V. For example, the C&MA rulebook identifies verses with "insignificant introductions" such as "He replied" as good candidates for FT questions. Likewise, if a verse starts in the middle of a sentence and would be awkward to start an FTV with, an FT may be chosen instead.
- "A pair of verses being used as a F2V (or FTN) does not preclude them from being used as a FTV (or FT) if they meet the remaining criteria." This means that the same verse may be asked as multiple different subtypes. Typically, there is one "best" way to include a verse in the private KVL, but there are uncommon instances where the private KVL may take advantage of this rule.

## October 18, 2019

For the purposes of awarding the starting 20-point team bonus, the officials will consider a quiz's scheduled start time to be 3 minutes after the close of any previous quiz in which any team in the upcoming quiz participates.

## August 19, 2019

Beginning with the 2019-2020 quiz season, PNW will use the question type distribution from the most recent revision of the official IBQ rule book. Prior to this year, PNW was not following the newer type distribution, but there was no formal rule indicating this. As of making this rule change, the most recent revision is the 2018 version and has the following requirements:

- 8-14 INT *on narrative material*; 9-16 INT *on epistle material*
- 3-4 Finish
- 2-3 Quote *on narrative material*; 3-4 Quote *on epistle material*
- 3-6 Reference *on narrative material*; 3-7 Reference *on epistle material*
- 1-2 MA
- 2-4 SIT *on narrative material*; 0 SIT *on epistle material*
