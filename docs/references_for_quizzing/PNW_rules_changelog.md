## August 19, 2019

Beginning with the 2019-2020 quiz season, PNW will use the question type distribution from the most recent revision of the official CMA rule book. Prior to this year, PNW was not following the newer type distribution, but there was no formal rule indicating this. As of making this rule change, the most recent revision is the 2018 version and has the following requirements:

- 8-14 INT *on narrative material*; 9-16 INT *on epistle material*
- 3-4 Finish
- 2-3 Quote *on narrative material*; 3-4 Quote *on epistle material*
- 3-6 Reference *on narrative material*; 3-7 Reference *on epistle material*
- 1-2 MA
- 2-4 SIT *on narrative material*; 0 SIT *on epistle material*
