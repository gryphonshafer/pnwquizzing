# CMA Rule Book

The PNW District uses the Quizzing rules approved by the Christian and
Missionary Alliance Quizzing Leadership Team. The CQLT is the authority on
rules. The PNW rule book supersedes the C&MA Rule Book for PNW District Meets.
The C&MA Bible Quizzing Rule Book (PDF) was last revised in 2017.

There is no publicized process for recommending changes to the C&MA Rule Book.
There IS now a publicized process for recommending changes to the C&MA Rule
Book.  There is a Q&A and suggestion meeting after Internationals each year.
Many rules are discussed in the Coaches Meeting at Internationals each year.
Recommendations may be made via survey that the CQLT distributes after
Internationals each year.  Any CQLT member is happy to intake rule book
recommendations.

There is no known or documented process explaining how rule book changes are
decided upon.  There IS a known (but not documented? yet?) process explaining
how rule book changes are decided upon.  The 2017 CMA Rule Book changes were
made after many solicitations of input and recommendations from every district,
and discussed at length by a Rule Book Sub-Committee composed of 5 members from
5 different districts (2 Canada, 3 US).
