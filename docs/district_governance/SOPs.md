# Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing Standard Operating Policies

The following are the Standard Operating Policies, hereinafter referred to as SOPs, of Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing, hereinafter referred to as PNW.

- SOPs Version: 2022-08-12

These SOPs are managed by the Board of Directors of PNW as per the PNW Bylaws.

## Documentation Availability

All documentation for PNW should be made easily available to all participants in PNW by publication on a web site and a network file sharing system. Whenever possible, these documents should be made public.

## Rules Codification

The Rules Subcommittee is responsible for overseeing the rules codification of PNW. Rules codificiation begins with the [CBQ rule book](https://cbqz.org/rules/CBQ_rule_book.md), accepted as the governing set of rules. The Rules Subcommittee may then develop a *Pacific Northwest Bible Quizzing Rules* document that provides adjustments to any settings allowed by the rules.

## Additional Documents

In addition to this SOP, there are sub-SOP documents that should be considered included as part of PNW's overall SOP. These documents are:

- [Quizzer Behavioral Expectations](behavioral_expectations.md)
- [Youth Protection Practices](youth_protection_practices.md)

## Quizzer Eligibility

PNW Quizzing recognizes that coaches (ministry organization Quizzing program leaders) are the best able due to their proximity to and time with Quizzing participants to determine the appropriateness of eligibility of each participant for their Quizzing teams. Therefore, head coaches are the ultimate decision-makers as to any given quizzer's eligibility for participation. However, all quizzers will be held to the standards of conduct described in [Quizzer Behavioral Expectations](behavioral_expectations.md).

## Specific Roles

The following a specific, single-person roles and their responsibilities.

    - Year-to-date balanced-weighted individual scoring average
    - Coach-confirmed memorization of at least 50% of the material at synonymous quality
- Maximum number of quizzers invited will be no greater than 20% of the district or 20 quizzers, whichever is lower

As far as team formation:

- 4-person teams will be preferred
- PNW teams 1 and 2 are "stacked"

Any changes to these policies will be decided by the Board of Directors and must be before District Meet 5.

- There are no fees for the Scramble Meet.

In addition:

- All fees are waived for ministries in their first year of PNW Quizzing participation.

### Host Facility Reimbursement

Every facility that hosts a quiz meet will receive:

- $100 for hosting
- +$50 for providing lunch
- +$50 for providing housing

### Weather Minimums

There may arise situations where the weather forecast predicts conditions unsafe for travel to, from, or about the meet location.

**General Principles:** We don't want to cancel any meet, but we have an obligation to cancel whenever the safe outcome of travel is ever in doubt. There isn't an easy way to decide this because there isn't a uniform standard weather minimum for safe travel shared across all drivers, vehicles, and locations. A meet shouldn't be canceled if most teams can safely travel to and from the meet; however, if any coach believes safe travel is in doubt due to weather and declines travel to a meet that isn't canceled, their teams should not be statistically penalized.

The following are the weather-related meet policies:

- A coach may, by citing what they feel is unsafe forecast weather conditions, decline to commute their teams to any meet. Such a decision must be made prior to the start of the meet. The coach needs to contact the District Coordinator as soon as possible following the decision. Given this case, the quizzers and teams from that ministry will have their averages calculated with the missing meet removed from the sum denominator.
- If more than a third of ministries decide to decline participation in a meet due to weather, the Board will cancel the meet.
- The Board will cancel the meet if at the meet location or along any common roadway where a majority of ministries will likely commute the following weather minimums are expected to be exceeded:
    - Ice on the roadway.
    - Snow accumulation of 2".
    - Freezing rain.
    - Visibility below 1 statue mile except for morning fog.
    - Flooding.
    - Electrical power loss at the meet location with no backup power capability.
- If the Board cancels a meet, all teams will have their averages calculated with the missing meet removed from the sum denominator.
