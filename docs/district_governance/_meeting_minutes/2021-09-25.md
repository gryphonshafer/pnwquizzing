## Summary of Discussions

The assembly discussed the current plan for hosting meets this season. They
discussed the pros and cons of the plan. They also discussed some of the
governing dynamics behind the decision-making process and the heuristics for
making these decisions.

Financially, this plan will put a burden on PNW Quizzing. The assembly voted to
raise participation fees to $50 per Ultrameetâ„¢ but keep the fees at $20 for any
normal, local district meets and District Championships. The assembly also
agreed to solicit tax-deductible donations from their churches and communities
to help cover extra costs.

It was also discussed that it would be best to take only 1 team of 5 to
Internationals this season.

At the moment, the Great West Invitational (GWI) meet details are ambiguous. CMD
expressed a strong desire that GWI be in-person. News and updates on GWI will be
shared when they become available.
