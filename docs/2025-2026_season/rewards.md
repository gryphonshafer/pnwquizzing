# Memorization Count Tracking, Awards, and Rewards

Starting in the Corinthians season, we’d like to deploy the following: We’d like to ask coaches to track (in whatever way or ways they deem best) the count of verses memorized per each of their quizzers. Report them to the meet director at the meet. (We’ll provide a simple paper-based form to coaches at the meet that they can fill out and hand in.)

We’ll recognize and reward quizzers who surpass cumulative verse count thresholds. We’re still working out exactly what the thresholds and rewards will be (suggestions welcome), but here’s our current/tentative/proposed plan: Upon crossing a threshold, the quizzer will receive a pin or lanyard indicating the threshold crossed, and each threshold pin/lanyard (when worn) unlocks rewards for the quizzer.

| Threshold | Rewards (Cumulative)                                                         |
| ---------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        20 | Front-of-line privileges during lunch (ordered by maximum threshold crossed) |
|        50 | May take treats from any officials’ table (for the quizzer’s own use)        |
|       100 | Invitation to exclusive Quizzing BBQ/grill party during the summer           |
|       200 | T-Shirt (CBQ-branded)                                                        |
|       300 | Water Bottle (CBQ-branded)                                                   |
|       400 | Hoodie (CBQ-branded)                                                         |
|       500 | Group scenic airplane ride (when weather and schedules permit)               |
|       600 | Qualify for official GWI teams + fully paid meet admission                   |
|       694 | Qualify for official IOC teams + fully paid meet admission                   |

Some of these rewards obviously carry with them some financial costs. Ideally, I’d like to keep per meet, per quizzer costs as low as possible. So my preference would be to fund the rewards requiring funding via donations. PNW Quizzing (and CBQ as well) is a recognized 501(c)3 organization, so donations are tax deductible. That said, any reward funding decisions are entirely up to the Assets and Governance Board.
