# Scorekeeping Advice

Scorekeeping is a great skill to learn and comes in handy if you are coaching a
team or want to be an official scorekeeper. Information on scorekeeping can be
found in the Official CMA Rule Book or in
[a handy pamphlet](scorekeeper_notes.doc)
created by Alliance Bible Church. Blank scoresheets are found here.

Accurate scorekeeping is crucial for keeping quizzes moving and the whole meet
on schedule. Each scorekeeper shares the responsibility (with the quizmaster) of
keeping that quiz room on schedule.

It is also the coaches responsibility to make sure the official score is
correct. When the score is announce, if you have a different score, please bring
it up immediately.

Coaches, please make sure you are verifying the official score sheet and
initialing promptly at the conclusion of each quiz.
