## Questions Writing Best Practices

This document serves as a tutorial and a guideline. It is not intended as some objective, black-and-white, rulebook, or anything to be used as the basis for challenges. 

Question writing is an art. Ideally this document will aid question writers in writing questions that:
1. are clear and understandable
2. test all parts of the material
3. utilize each different question type effectively
4. material should be tested through a variety of types, and a variety of "structures"

There are many examples of questions that meet all 4 criteria, but are still different. This is fine. We are not intending for all question writers to write questions that are indistinguishable from questions from any other writer. 

If a question writer's questions cause quizzers to flinch, think extra to understand, or anything else "unexpected" then the questions should be examined to see if there are "better" ways to write them. 


## Assumptions and Caveats

## Question Types
### Interrogative, (also known as General, Standard, Straightforward, Regular)

Interrogative questions are the simplest and most prevalent questions in bible quizzing. In many ways they are the backbone of quizzing, as they are accessible to all quizzers. 

#### "Throwaway" words beginning the question
There are many leading words that MAY give very little information (e.g. so, but, then, if). If in the context of the question that word truly doesn't add any meaning, then there's no reason to include it at the beginning of the question. This isn't necessarily a desire to make the question "unique" as fast as possible. It's just a desire to not test the quizzer on inconsequential material. 

#### Leading vs. trailing Interrogative words
Interrogative questions that begin with the inserted interrogative word, all things being equal, are harder than ones that end with the inserted interrogative word. This reality should not cause the question writer to favor one question structure over another. The desire should be to meet the 4 criteria.

#### If, then flow
Let's use this phrase as our example: "If you are sleepy, you should go to sleep."  It would be unclear and awkward to write a question Q: "If you are what?" A: Sleepy. It artifically truncates the complete thought from the entire IF clause. A clearer and less awkward question would be: Q: "If you are sleepy, what?" A: "You should go to sleep."

It is fine to write the question Q: "You should what?" A: "Go to sleep" because starting the question halfway into the IF clause in essence removes that "strcture" from the question, and you're just asking one isolated thing that is clear. Similarly, it would be fine to write Q: "You are what?" A: "Sleepy" 

#### Question + Answer length
Questions should not be unduly long. This is edtremely subjective, but is important to consider. On the flipside, if the phrase is "He dove into the ballistic whale" you may often see question that focus on the global unique word "ballistic" Q: "Ballistic what?" A: "Whale"  There's no need to start the question artificially RIGHT AT the unique word. Instead Q: "The ballistic what?" A: "Whale" is smoother and more natural for the quizmaster to read and for the quizzer to answer. 

#### 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 word unique phrases
Harkening back to the "Leading vs. trailing Interrogative words" section, there shouldn't necessarily be a desire to write either a LOT OF or FEW questions with a specific "unique word phrase length." Just write questions that meet the 4 criteria. You may get a question that isn't unique for a handful of syllables. There should not be a desire to skew away from these sorts of questions. If the question meets the 4 criteria, write it!

If two questions start with the same first 4 words, writing both as Interrogative MAY violate Criteria #3. If the material can be BETTER tested by a different question type (reference question for example), do that instead!

We should never be trying to FOOL the quizzer. We should also never be trying to either make things easy on the quizzer, or make things difficult. We're just trying to test the quizzer on the entire material, using all the question types and sub-types, and using many different "structures."
