# Intrameet Schedules

This season, there will be potentially 3 different intrameet schedules.

## *Classic* Scramble™

The
[*Classic* Scramble™](/district_governance/_meeting_minutes/2021-04-13.md#iclassiciscramblesuptmsup)
meet style means teams self-form, there will be more non-quizzing downtime, and
there will be more fun and games time throughout.

## District "Pivot" Meets

There won't be any "regular" district meets as in past years. Instead, if we
are able to conduct a WA/OR district meet, these will be "pivot" meets based
on available host options. It's possible we won't have any "pivot" meets this
season. The exact schedule for these may be based on the following template:
