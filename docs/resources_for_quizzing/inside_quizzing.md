# Inside Quizzing Podcast

The "Inside Quizzing" podcast is a more-or-less weekly podcast from quizmasters Gryphon Shafer and Scott Peterson. Each week, these two will discuss quizzing topics, details about the memorization material on a typical quiz season schedule, and anything else they find interesting related to Bible quizzing.
