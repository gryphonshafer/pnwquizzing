# Specific PNW Quizzing Rules

The following are the Bible Quizzing rules that are specific to PNW Quizzing. These are local district additional rules, policies, and practices for Quizzing.

These rules are managed by the PNW Rules Subcommittee as per the PNW Bylaws and Standard Operating Policies (SOPs).

## Bracket Types

Quiz meets will be comprised of preliminary score sum bracket consisting of all registered teams. Each team should be given the same number of quizzes therein, with as many being 3-team quizzes as possible, and 2-team quizzes only as necessary to ensure an equal total quiz-per-team count.

Following the score sum bracket, there will be 1 or more "top-9" positional brackets and an "auxiliary" positional bracket. The teams sorted by total team score from the score sum bracket will fill the 1 or more "top-9" positional brackets, and the remaining teams will be placed in the "auxiliary" positional bracket.

There will be at least 1 but possibly multiple finals/championships quizzes of the top 3 teams from the "top-9" positional brackets.

## Club List Weighting

The club lists will be weighted as follows:

- Preliminary score sum quizzes are:
    - Club 100: weight of 1
    - Club 300: weight of 2
    - Full Material: weight of 3
- “Top-9” positional quizzes and finals/championships quizzes are:
    - Club 100: weight of 0
    - Club 300: weight of 1
    - Full Material: weight of 1
- Auxiliary score sum quizzes are:
    - Club 100: weight of 3
    - Club 300: weight of 2
    - Full Material: weight of 1

## Individual Averages

Quizzer individual averages for a meet are computed as follows:

- Each bracket's quizzes are averaged *(with exceptions; see next)*
- Finals/championships quiz scores do not count toward individual averages
- Auxiliary score sum quizzes have their averages reduced by 50%

Quizzer individual averages for a season are computed as follows:

- Scramble and pre-season meets are ignored
- For meets 1, 2, and 3: drop the lowest score of these, then the remaining 2 count 10% each
- For meet 4: count at 20%
- For meet 5: count at 25%
- District Championships: count at 35%

<!--

Tie-breaking for individual quizzer standings (both at a meet and across the season):

1. Total quizzer points
2. Most quizzes in which the quizzer earned points
3. Standard deviation of quiz scores

-->

## Great West Invitational (GWI) Qualification

We invite quizzers by year-to-date average, but we require quizzers to be eligible by their tracking of their memorization of at least 50% of the material at the synonymous quality level or better. Coaches will have the final say as to whether a quizzers of theirs has fulfilled this requirement.

## Meet Cancellation due to Inclement Weather

The Board of Directors will decide if a quiz meet needs to be canceled due to inclement weather. If individual quizzers or whole teams of quizzers are unable to attend a meet due to inclement weather, the Board of Directors will determine if such absences are justified, and such determination will not be unreasonably withheld.

For individuals missing a meet due to weather:

- If missing one of the first 3 meets or District Championships, the individual will receive a 0 average for that meet
- If missing District Meet 4, the individual will receive a 0 for 10% of that meet and 10% weight applied to District Meet 5
- If missing District Meet 5, the individual will receive a 0 for 10% of that meet and 15% weight applied to District Championships

For teams missing a meet due to weather:

- If missing District Meet 3, the team will receive Last Place for 15% of that meet and 10% weight applied to District Meet 4
- If missing District Meet 4, the team will receive Last Place for 25% of that meet and 10% weight applied to District Meet 5
- If missing District Meets 1, 2, 5, or District Championships, the team will receive Last Place for that meet
