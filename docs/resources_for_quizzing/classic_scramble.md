# Classic Scramble™

The following explains team formation, officials selection, and schedule
for Classic Scramble™ meets.

## Team Formation

Quizzers (for the purposes of Scramble defined as anyone who wants to quiz at
Scramble, regardless of normal quizzing eligibility) self-organize into teams.
They are incentivized to build diverse teams via the following scoring
alterations:

- Teams will receive +2 points at the start of every quiz for each of the following:
    - Teams with quizzers from at least 2 churches
    - Teams with at least 1 rookie (non-adult)
    - Teams with at least 1 adult who didn't quiz as a youth

Quizzers will be given "ID sheets" where they will record:

- Name
- Church
- Rookie (non-adult) Y/N
- Adult without quizzing XP Y/N

Quizzers will have 20 minutes to self-organize into teams. Once formed, teams
fill out roster sheets to provide officials during the meet.

During the lunch break, teams may trade quizzers between each other.

## Officials

The following are the eligibility requirements for Scramble meet officials:

- QMs: Any adult, or any quizzer in their senior year
- Scorekeepers: Anyone

Everyone wanting to officiate should chat with the seated officials in a given
room about picking up the officiating of the next quiz.

## Schedule Generation

There's no schedule. Teams should place their rosters on the officials' table
in a given room, in arrival order. The officials will call teams to quiz based
on the arrival order of their rosters.
