## PNW-Specific Rules Settings

Note that in addition, there are certain PNW-specific rules settings that we
use under the CBQ rule book. These are they:

### Club List Weighting

The club lists will be weighted as follows:

- Preliminary score sum quizzes are:
    - Club 100: weight of 1 (thus 40% probability a query is unique to this set)
    - Club 250: weight of 2 (thus 35% probability a query is unique to this set)
    - Full Material: weight of 3 (thus 25% probability a query is unique to this set)
- Top 9 positional quizzes and finals quizzes are:
    - Club 100: weight of 0 (thus 20% probability a query is unique to this set)
    - Club 250: weight of 0 (thus 30% probability a query is unique to this set)
    - Full Material: weight of 1 (thus 50% probability a query is unique to this set)
- Weighted score sum quizzes are:
    - Club 100: weight of 3 (thus 67% probability a query is unique to this set)
    - Club 250: weight of 2 (thus 25% probability a query is unique to this set)
    - Full Material: weight of 1 (thus 8% probability a query is unique to this set)

### New Material Versus Old








### Season Individual Averages

Quizzer individual averages are computed as follows:

- Within a given quiz season:
    - Meets 1-3: drop the lowest, the remaining 2 count 10% each
    - Meet 4: 20%
    - Meet 5: 25%
    - District Championships: 35%

### Meet Cancelation due to Inclement Weather

The Board of Directors will decide if a quiz meet needs to be canceled due to inclement weather. If individual quizzers or whole teams of quizzers are unable to attend a meet due to inclement weather, the Board of Directors will determine if such absences are justified, and such determination will not be unreasonably withheld.

For individuals missing a meet due to weather:

- If missing one of the first 3 meets or District Championships, the individual will receive a 0 average for that meet
- If missing District Meet 4, the individual will receive a 0 for 10% of that meet and 10% weight applied to District Meet 5
- If missing District Meet 5, the individual will receive a 0 for 10% of that meet and 15% weight applied to District Championships

For teams missing a meet due to weather:

- If missing District Meet 3, the team will receive Last Place for 15% of that meet and 10% weight applied to District Meet 4
- If missing District Meet 4, the team will receive Last Place for 25% of that meet and 10% weight applied to District Meet 5
- If missing District Meets 1, 2, 5, or District Championships, the team will receive Last Place for that meet
