## Minutes

### PNW Bank Balance and Quizzer Fees

Discussed PNW bank account that currently has $12,977.57 in it and what fees should be this year for quizzers.

Voted on unanimously to charge $5 per quizzer per meet maintaining hosting credits. If credits happen to be more than what a church owes for the year, it will zero out their balance owed. We will not write churches a check for any additional credits.

### Great West

Andrew is getting final count for Great West on Sat. 3/22 at which point, we will look at hotels and book quickly.

### Championships

Kristine asked to use the Google Form that Sharalyn used two years ago for District Championship registration. All registration will be final 3 weeks prior to the start of District Championships (4/11/25 deadline). Kristine is going to emphasize that there are no refunds for changes in registrations after the deadline however, if a situation comes up with need for scholarships or dire need/circumstances, the board can meet to discuss and decide to award scholarships on an as need basis.
