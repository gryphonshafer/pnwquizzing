COVID shutdowns both hurt and helped the finances as there was very little spend at first, but we also reduced prices for that time frame for virtual meets.

We started the 2022-2021 season with $5,889.16 in the account.

- Income of $1,210 *(virtual fees)*
- Expenditures of $4,000 *(Internationals)*
- Ending total of $3,099.16

## Evangelism and Recruiting

- Western Christianity is in deep, systemic decline (both organizationally and culturally)
    - A collective of multi-church regional pastors representing organizations of churches along the west cost met first in Portland and then Sacramento
    - I was part of those conferences both as an ordained pastor and board chairman of one of the multi-church organizations
    - The pastors wrestled with what's been happening the last few decades, and we came up with the following:

> The Body of Christ on the Pacific Coast of the United States has struggled to present an effective and compelling witness of Jesus, animated by the Holy Spirit.
> In our present reality, cultural Christianity has obscured the Gospel, and an original witness of biblically-grounded salt and light has been lost.
> As a result, the Body of Christ is seen as nonessential when considering the most complex challenges individuals, families, and communities face on the Pacific Coast.
> There is a cultural seeking that, by and large, has not found the Church to have answers.

- We need to change this
    - And we can change this only by changing ourselves
    - And we can change ourselves only through discipleship
- Bible Quizzing is the most effective discipleship ministry when measured by ROI
    - And I truly believe Bible Quizzing is one of only a few ways we can restore Western Christianity
    - And the only way we grow Quizzing is through your continued efforts
    - I'm asking that we all double-down on our efforts to spread the word
- Please do everything you can to evangelize and recruit new churches into Quizzing
    - Please make a point to evangelize Quizzing with your Christian friends from other churches
    - Please let me know anything I can do to help then get a program started

## Season Schedule Details

- See the [meet schedule on the web site](/2022-2023_season/season_schedule.md)
- Great West is in April... probably
    - We need coaches, vans, and drivers (we won't have Kraig/Kim most likely)
    - Please consider volunteering
    - Staying in Sandpoint worked out well last year
    - How many quizzers? Last year we took top 12, but historically we took top 25
    - **The assembly decided we should target taking the top 16 quizzers to Great West, but we will revisit this decision based on how we perceive the district strength to be over the first couple meets.**
- District Champtionships is scheduled to be held at Double K (again)
    - Similar to last season: come early + stay late options (and lots of facilities options available)
    - Costs will likely be similar to last season's DC (which was whatever the camp charged)
    - Please consider this event an opportunity to invite quizzing-curious folks
    - Historically, DC has been only top % of teams; but last few years we've invited all teams
    - Should we continue to have DC be open invitation this season?
    - **The assembly decided we will continue to invite all teams to DC.**
